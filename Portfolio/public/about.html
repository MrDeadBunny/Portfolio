<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer in the making.
  Currently, I'm pursuing a full-stack development course covering modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and the basics of Web3 and DApps.
  I'm also close to graduating from university, and I'm working on my first independent web project, aiming to turn ideas into interactive, real-world applications.
  
  I love creativity in web design and always look forward to learning new tools and building exciting projects.
